# CS570-Machine-Learning
A collection of machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch as part of my coursework.
# Overview

This repository contains various machine learning algorithms implemented without external ML libraries like NumPy or Scikit-Learn. Instead, I leveraged core Python libraries such as re, typing, and collections to build algorithms from the ground up.
 Project List
 1. main.py

Takes in .arff files and stores the data found in the file for future algorithms.

2. ID3 and ID3 main

Takes in .arff files and uses stored information within dictionaries from training file, with the use of prepruning to increase prediction accuracy within any selected attribute.

3. KNN and KNN Main

Takes in .arff files and uses stored information from training file within dictionaries to create predictions based on 'k' nearest instances

4. NB and NaivesBayesmain.main

Takes in .arff files and uses stored information from training file within dictionaries to create predictions, with the option to use Laplace smoothing

#Technologies Used

    Python (re, typing, collections)

    File handling and data parsing

    Algorithmic optimization
